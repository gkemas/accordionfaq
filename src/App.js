          An e-book is an electronic version of a traditional print book that
          can be read by using a personal computer or an e-book reader. When you
          think about it, it actually means that you can have all your favorite
          books stored in your pocket and you can read what you want, depending
          on your mood. So, in addition, we wrote down some questions that are
          commonly asked in the e-book community
